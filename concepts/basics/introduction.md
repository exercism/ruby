# Introduction

Ruby is a dynamic [object-oriented language][object-oriented-programming]. Everything in Ruby is an [object][object].

There are two primary ways to assign objects to names in Ruby - using variables or constants. Variables are always written in [snake case][snake-case]. A variable can reference different objects over its lifetime. For example, `my_first_variable` can be defined and redefined many times using the `=` operator:

```ruby
my_first_variable = 1
my_first_variable = "Some string"
my_first_variable = SomeComplexObject.new
```

Constants, however, are meant to be assigned once. They must start with capital letters and are normally written in block capitals with words separated by underscores. For example:

```ruby
MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 10

# Redefining not allowed
# MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = "Some String"
```

Ruby is organised into classes. Classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class. Objects are generally created by instantiating classes using the `.new` method. For example:

```ruby
# Define the class
class Calculator
  #...
end

# Create an instance of it and assign it to a variable
my_first_calc = Calculator.new
```

Units of functionality are encapsulated in methods - similar to _functions_ in other languages. A method can optionally be defined with positional arguments, and/or keyword arguments that are defined and called using the `:` syntax. Methods either implicitly return the result of the last evaluated statement, or can explicitly return an object via the `return` keyword. Methods are invoked using `.` syntax.

```ruby
class Calculator

  # Unnamed params
  def add(num1, num2)
    return num1 + num2 # Explicit return
  end

  # Named params
  def multiply(num1:, num2:)
    num1 * num2 # Implicit return
  end
end

calc = Calculator.new
calc.add(1, 3)
calc.multiply(num1: 2, num_2: 5)
```

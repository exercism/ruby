# About

## Key Points:

- When a class' `.new` method is called to create an object instance, the `.initialize` method is passed all arguments to initialize the instance's state.
- instance variable names are prefixed with `@`.
- instance variables default to `nil` until they are explicitly set.
- instance variables are private by default, and they should be manipulated with getters and setters

```ruby
class Backpack
  initialize(owner)
    @owner = owner
  end

  def owner
    @owner
  end

  def owner=(new_owner)
    @owner = new_owner
  end
end
```

- Methods named with a trailing `=` are recognized as setters by Ruby, and allow the optional use of the assignment syntax, e.g. `Backpack.new("Sven").owner = "Ayah"`
- Getters and setters can be shortened using the `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and `attr_accessor` methods:
  - `attr_reader`: Create getters for the symbols listed
  - `attr_writer`: Create setters for the symbols listed
  - `attr_accessor`: Create getters and setters for the symbols listed

```ruby
class Backpack
  attr_accessor :owner

  initialize(owner)
    @owner = owner
  end
end
```

- Why use getters and setters rather than the instance variable directly?
  - If there was a typogrpahical error (we call this "typo") in the previous example (e.g. `@ownar`), it would silently be assigned `nil`, potentially introducing a bug into the system.
  - Getters and setters make this explicit, and will raise an error when a typo is made

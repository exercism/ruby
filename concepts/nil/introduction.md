# Introduction


[Nil][nil-dictionary] is an English word meaning "nothing" or "zero". In Ruby, `nil` is used to express the _absence_ of an object. In other programming languages, `null` or `none` values may play a similar role.

```ruby
# I do not have a favorite color
favorite_color = nil
```

Ruby gives any instance variable the default value of `nil` when it is first encountered, until it is set otherwise.

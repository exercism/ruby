# How to implement a Ruby concept exercise

This document describes how to implement a concept exercise for the Ruby track.

**Please please please read the docs before starting.** Posting PRs without reading these docs will be a lot more frustrating for you during the review cycle, and exhaust Exercism's maintainers' time. So, before diving into the implementation, please read the following documents:

- [The features of v3][docs-features-of-v3].
- [Rationale for v3][docs-rationale-for-v3].
- [What are concept exercise and how they are structured?][docs-concept-exercises]

Please also watch the following video:

- [The Anatomy of a Concept Exercise][anatomy-of-a-concept-exercise].

As this document is generic, `<NAME>` will be used as the placeholder for the name of the exercise in underscore-case (e.g. `calculator_conundrum`) and `<CONCEPT>` will be used as the placeholder for the name of a concept.

Before implementing the exercise, please make sure you have a good understanding of what the exercise should be teaching (and what not). This information can be found in the exercise's GitHub issue. Having done this, please read the [Ruby concept exercises introduction][concept-exercises].

To implement a concept exercise, the following files must be added:

<pre>
languages
└── ruby
    ├── concepts
    |   └── <CONCEPT>
    |       ├── about.md
    |       └── links.json
    └── exercises
        └── concept
            └── <NAME>
                ├── .docs
                |   ├── instructions.md
                |   ├── introduction.md
                |   ├── hints.md
                |   └── source.md (required if there are third-party sources)
                ├── .meta
                |   |── config.json
                |   |── design.md
                |   └── exemplar.rb
                ├── <NAME>.rb
                └── <NAME>_test.rb
</pre>

## Step 1: Add code files

The code files are track-specific and should be designed to help the student learn the exercise's concepts. The following Ruby code files must be added (not necessarily in this order):

- `<NAME>.rb`. the stub implementation file, which is the starting point for students to work on the exercise.
- `<NAME>_test.rb`: the test suite.
- `.meta/exemplar.rb`: an exemplar implementation that passes all the tests.

## Step 2: Add documentation files

How to create the files common to all tracks is described in the [how to implement a concept exercise document][how-to-implement-a-concept-exercise].

## Step 3: Update list of implemented exercises

- Add the exercise to the [list of implemented exercises][implemented-exercises].

## Step 4: Add analyzer (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an exercise-specific [analyzer][analyzer]. If so, specify what analysis rules should be applied to this exercise and why.

_Skip this step if you're not sure what to do._

## Step 5: Add representation (optional)

Some exercises could benefit from having an custom representation as generated by the [Ruby representer][representer]. If so, specify what changes to the representation should be applied and why.

_Skip this step if you're not sure what to do._

## Inspiration

When implementing an exercise, it can be very useful to look at already implemented Ruby exercises like the [strings exercise][concept-exercise-strings]. You can also check the exercise's [general concepts documents][reference] to see if other languages have already implemented an exercise for that concept.

## Help

If you have any questions regarding implementing the exercise, please post them as comments in the exercise's GitHub issue.

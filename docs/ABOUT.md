# About

Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.
It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

Ruby was created as a language of careful balance.
Its creator, [Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto), blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

He has often said that he is "trying to make Ruby natural, not simple," in a way that mirrors life.

Building on this, he adds: "Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body."

# Alphanumeric Pattern Generator

Create a program that can generate and manage [alphanumeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric) strings based off a given pattern.

An alphanumeric pattern is a string that contains alphabetic and numeric characters. In our example, `.` represents alphabetic characters (a-z) and `#` represents numeric characters (0-9), so the pattern `.#` could produce anything from `A0` to `Z9`.

An alphanumeric patterns can also have constant values. For example, the pattern `#.JH1.` could generate any pattern including the values `JH1` as index 2 ,3 and 4 respectively such as `9FJH1P`.

# OCR Numbers

Given a 3 x 4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, determine which number is
represented, or whether it is garbled.

# Step One

To begin with, convert a simple binary font to a string containing 0 or 1.

The binary font uses pipes and underscores, four rows high and three columns wide.

```text
     _   #
    | |  # zero.
    |_|  #
         # the fourth row is always blank
```

Is converted to "0"

```text
         #
      |  # one.
      |  #
         # (blank fourth row)
```

Is converted to "1"

If the input is the correct size, but not recognizable, your program should return '?'

If the input is the incorrect size, your program should return an error.

# Step Two

Update your program to recognize multi-character binary strings, replacing garbled numbers with ?

# Step Three

Update your program to recognize all numbers 0 through 9, both individually and as part of a larger string.

```text
 _ 
 _|
|_ 
   
```

Is converted to "2"

```text
      _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #
    | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.
    ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #
                                 # fourth line is always blank
```

Is converted to "1234567890"

# Step Four

Update your program to handle multiple numbers, one per line. When converting several lines, join the lines with commas.

```text
    _  _ 
  | _| _|
  ||_  _|
         
    _  _ 
|_||_ |_ 
  | _||_|
         
 _  _  _ 
  ||_||_|
  ||_| _|
         
```

Is converted to "123,456,789"

Some editors trim whitespace. If you rely on trailing whitespace in a multiline string,
instead use a format that doesn't rely on trailing whitespace, or adjust the settings in your editor.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[Ruby resources page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby/resources).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

Run the tests from the exercise directory using the following command:

    ruby ocr_numbers_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride ocr_numbers_test.rb

# Hints

## General

- If you're not sure how to start the refactor, watch the talk ["All the Little Things"][all-the-little-things] by Sandi Metz, and pause it as soon as you find inspiration. Try not to watch the whole talk until after you've solved the exercise! Then you can watch the rest of the talk and improve upon your first iteration.

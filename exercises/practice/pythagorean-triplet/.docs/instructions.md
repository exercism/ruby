A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers (positive integers), {a, b, c}, for which,

```text
a² + b² = c²
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3² + 4² = 5².
```

Given certain conditions for the triplet, like the maximum possible value (`max_factor`), the minimum possible value (`min_factor`) or the sum of the integers, find all Pythagorean triplets that are possible such that `a² + b² = c²` and they are within the max and min values. 

For example, given the maximum value of 5, return an array with a single Triplet object of value `{3,4,5}`. 

Or given  N = 1000 as the sum, return exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.

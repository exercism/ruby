In this exercise you're practicing iterating over an array, meaning: executing an operation on each element of an array. Ruby has many useful built-in methods for iterations. Take a look at [this article][how-to-iterate].

Most of the methods listed in the article are not methods specifically for Array, but come from [Enumerable][Enumerable]. The article doesn't list iterating over _consecutive elements_. The first challenge is to find a method that does.

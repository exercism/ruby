# Hints

## General

- A good starting point is a brute-force recursive solution.
You can see it sketched out in the first half of the article ["Demystifying the 0-1 knapsack problem: top solutions explained"](demystifying-the-knapsack-problem).
- For a more efficient solution, you can improve your recursive solution using _dynamic programming_, which is introduced in the second half of [the above-mentioned article](demystifying-the-knapsack-problem).
For a more general explainer, see the video ["5 Simple Steps for Solving Dynamic Programming Problems"](solving-dynamic-programming-problems)
- If you need a more visual walkthrough of how to apply dynamic programming to the knapsack problem, see the video ["0/1 Knapsack problem | Dynamic Programming"](0-1-knapsack-problem).
Also worth mentioning is [this answer](intuition-of-dp-for-knapsack-problem) to a question on Reddit, _"What is the intuition behind Knapsack problem solution using dynamic programming?"_.
Below is the answer in full.

> The intuition behind the solution is basically like any dynamic programming solution: split the task into many sub-tasks, and save solutions to these sub-tasks for later use.
>
> In this case the sub task is to **"Try to fit x items into a knapsack of a smaller size"** instead of trying all possible variations in the whole thing right away.
>
> The idea here is that at any point you can ask, *"Does this item fit into the sack at all?"*
> If not, you repeat by looking at a bigger portion of the sack until you reach the whole size of it.
> If the item still doesn't fit, then it's simply not part of any solution.
>
> If it does fit, however, then there are two options.
> Either the maximum value for that portion of the sack is achieved without the item, or with the item.
> If the former is true then we can just take the previous solution because we already tried the previous items.
> (For example, if we try item 4 and it doesn't increase our maximum then we can just use our previous solution for items 1-3.)
> If the latter is true then we put item 4 in, which takes some value off of our capacity.
> The remaining capacity gets filled with a previous solution.
> How?
> Well, we already tried smaller capacities beforehand, so there should be a solution for that smaller, in this case remaining, capacity.
>
> So the idea is to split the entire knapsack problem into smaller knapsack problems.
> Instead of testing 10 items with capacity 50, you first try (after the trivial case of 0) 1 item and capacity 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 (or however many sub tasks you want to create) and then take another item and start again at capacity 10.
>
> If you see item 1 fits into capacity 20+, then all these slots in the table now contain this value.
> Then you look at item 2 from capacity 10-50 again.
> Let's assume item 2 fits into capacity 20 as well.
> Then now you check whether it is a new maximum or not, and if it is, then you update the table.
> Now you look at capacity 30 for item 2.
> You see that item 2 fits; this means 10 capacity would remain if you take it.
> However there, as of now, was no item that fits into 10 capacity, thus the solution remains the same as before.
> At 40 this changes: you now realize that even if you include item 2 there are 20 capacity remaining, thus you can fill that space with the previous solution, which was item 1.
> Thus for 40 capacity, as of now, the optimal solution is to take item 1 and 2.
> And so on.

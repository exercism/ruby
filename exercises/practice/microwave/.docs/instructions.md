# Instructions

Convert the buttons entered on the microwave panel to their timer equivalent.

Microwave timers are smart enough to know that when you press 90 for seconds, you mean '01:30', which is 90 seconds. We want to have a "smart display" that will convert this to the lowest form of minutes and seconds, rather than leaving it as 90 seconds.

Build a class that accepts buttons entered and converts them to the proper display panel time.

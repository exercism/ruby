Tally the results of a small football competition. Based on an input file containing which team played against which and what the outcome was create a file with a table like this:

Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P
Devastating Donkeys            |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |  7
Allegoric Alaskians            |  3 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  6
Blithering Badgers             |  3 |  1 |  0 |  2 |  3
Courageous Californians        |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1
The outcome should be ordered by points, descending. To keep things simple ties are broken by looking at the number of wins and if that doesn't solve anything by ordering the team names alphabetically.

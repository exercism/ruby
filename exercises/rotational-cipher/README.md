Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.

The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on
transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key
between `0` and `26`. Using a key of `0` or `26` will always yield
the same output due to modular arithmetic. The letter is shifted
for as many values as the value of the key.

The general notation for rotational ciphers is `ROT + <key>`.
The most commonly used rotational cipher is `ROT13`.

A `ROT13` on the Latin alphabet would be as follows:

```plain
Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm
```

It is stronger than the Atbash cipher because it has 27 possible keys, and 25 usable keys.

Ciphertext is written out in the same formatting as the input including spaces and punctuation.

## Examples
- ROT5  `omg` gives `trl`
- ROT0  `c` gives `c`
- ROT26 `Cool` gives `Cool`
- ROT13 `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` gives `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.`
- ROT13 `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.` gives `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride hello_world_test.rb

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.

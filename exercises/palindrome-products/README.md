# Palindrome Products

Detect palindrome products in a given range.

A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are
reversed. For example, `121` is a palindromic number but `112` is not.

Given the definition of a palindromic number, we define a palindrome _product_
to be the product `c`, such that `a * b = c`, where `c` is a palindromic number and
 `a` and `b` are integers (possibly, but _not_ necessarily palindromic numbers).

For example, the palindromic number 9009 can be written as the palindrome
product: `91 * 99 = 9009`.

It's possible (and indeed common) for a palindrome product to be the product
of multiple combinations of numbers. For example, the palindrome product `9` has
the factors `(1, 9)`, `(3, 3)`, and `(9, 1)`.

Write a program that given a range of integers, returns the smallest and largest
palindromic product within that range, along with all of it's factors.

## Example 1

Given the range `[1, 9]` (both inclusive)...

And given the list of all possible products within this range:
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 15, 21, 24, 27, 20, 28, 32, 36, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 42, 48, 54, 49, 56, 63, 64, 72, 81]`

The smallest palindrome product is `1`. It's factors are `(1, 1)`.
The largest palindrome product is `9`. It's factors are `(1, 9)`, `(3, 3)`, and `(9, 1)`.

## Example 2

Given the range `[10, 99]` (both inclusive)...

The smallest palindrome product is `121`. It's factors are `(11, 11)`.
The largest palindrome product is `9009`. It's factors are `(91, 99)` and `(99, 91)`.

[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby).

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory. For example, if the test suite is called
`hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:

    ruby hello_world_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride hello_world_test.rb

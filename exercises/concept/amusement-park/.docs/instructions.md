Working with an amusement park, you've been handed a specification to design a system to administer attendance and rides. You've been tasked with modeling the Attendee (person visiting the park).

## 1. Make new attendees

Implement the `Attendee#initialize` method of the `Attendee` class, it should take a height (in centimeters) and store it as an instance variable

```ruby
Attendee.new(106)
# => #<Attendee:0x000055c33e6c7e18 @height=106>
```

## 2. How tall is the attendee

Implement the `Attendee#height` getter of the `Attendee` class, it should return the instances height

```ruby
Attendee.new(106).height
# => 106
```

## 3. What is the ride pass' id

Not all attendees have bought a ride pass, but we need to know if they have a pass or not. Implement the `Attendee#pass_id` getter for the `Attendee` class, it should return the instance's pass_id or `nil` if the Attendee doesn't have one.

```ruby
Attendee.new(106).pass_id
# => nil
```

## 4. Allow people to buy a pass

Implement `Attendee#issue_pass!` to mutate the state of the instance, and set the pass id instance varaiable to the argument. It should return the pass id.

```ruby
attendee = Attendee.new(106)
attendee.issue_pass!(42)
attendee.pass_id
# => 42
```

## 4. Revoke the pass

Some guests break the rules with unsafe behavior, so the park wants to be able to revoke passes. Implement `Attendee#revoke_pass` to mutate the state of the instance, and set the pass id to `nil`

```ruby
attendee = Attendee.new(106)
attendee.issue_pass!(42)
attendee.revoke_pass!
attendee.pass_id
# => nil
```

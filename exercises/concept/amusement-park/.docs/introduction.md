## Instance Variables

## Nil

## Object state, instance variables

Objects can hold their own state by setting _instance variables_, which are created by prefixing `@` to a variable name.

```ruby
@name = 2
```

Objects usually set their initial state in an `initialize` method, which is automatically called when calling `new` on a class.

```ruby
class Airplane
  def initialize
    @wings = 2
  end
end
```

The `initialize` method may also take arguments, so that each instance can start with a custom state:

```ruby
class Suitcase
  def initialize(locked)
    @locked = locked
  end
end
```

Consider _instance_ variables to be private from external read and writes. _Instance_ methods should be used for getting and setting instance variables:

```ruby
class Suitcase
  #...

  def locked? # Query methods should be named with a trailing `?`
    @locked
  end

  def unlock! # Methods which mutate state should have trailing `!`
    @locked = false
  end
end
```

## Nil

[Nil][nil-dictionary] is an English word meaning "nothing" or "zero". In Ruby, `nil` is used to express the _absence_ of an object. In other programming languages, `null` or `none` values may play a similar role.

```ruby
# I do not have a favorite color
favorite_color = nil
```

Ruby gives any instance variable the default value of `nil` when it is first encountered, until it is set otherwise.

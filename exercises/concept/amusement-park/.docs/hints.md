## 1. Make new attendees

- Using the references, complete the initialize method to save the height to the object's state.

## 2. How tall is the attendee

- Create a getter for the saved height state.

## 3. What is the ride pass's id

- Create a getter for the pass id.
- It is okay and expected to return `nil` before a pass is issued to the `Attendee`.

## 4. Allow people to buy a pass

- Using the `Attendee#issue_pass!` method, set the instance's state to the argument.

## 4. Revoke the pass

- Using the `Attendee#revoke_pass!` setter method set the instance's state so that no pass exists.

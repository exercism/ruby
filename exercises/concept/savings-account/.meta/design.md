# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the concept of floating-point numbers and introduce them to loops.

## Learning objectives

- Know about the [Float][float-class] class and some of its methods.
- Know how to write a `while`, `until` and `loop` loop.

## Out of scope

- Parsing floating-point types from strings.
- Converting floating-point types to strings.
- Using standard or custom format strings.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `floating-point-numbers`
- `loops`: know how to write a `while`, `until` and `loop` loop.

## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisite concepts are:

- `numbers`: define numbers and apply arithmetic and boolean logic to them.
- `conditionals`: conditionally execute code based on value of floating-point numbers.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].

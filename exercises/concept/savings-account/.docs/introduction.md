## Floating Point Numbers

## Loops

A floating-point number is a number with zero or more digits behind the decimal separator. Examples are `4.0`, `0.1`, `3.14`, `-6.4` `16.984025` and `1024.0`.
In Ruby, floating-point numbers are implemented through the [Float](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Float.html) class.

In this exercise you may also want to use a loop. There are several ways to write loops in Ruby, one of them is the `while` loop:

```ruby
counter = 0

while counter < 5
  counter += 1
end
```

# Hints

## General

## 1. Calculate the interest rate

- Using an `if` or `case` statement can be useful when checking conditions.

## 2. Calculate the annual balance update

- When calculating the annual yield, it might be useful to temporarily convert a negative balance to a positive one. The `Float` class has a method to convert both positive and negative values to their absolute value.

## 3. Calculate the years before reaching the desired balance

- To calculate the years, one can keep looping until the desired balance is reached.

# Hints

## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [constant][constant] which should contain the [integer][integers] value specified in the recipe.

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [method][methods] with a single parameter for the actual time so far.
- You can [implicitly return an integer][return] from the method.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for subtraction][operators] to subtract values.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [method][methods] with a single parameter for the number of layers.
- You can [implicitly return an integer][return] from the method.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for multiplicaton][operators] to multiply values.
- You could define an extra constant for the time in minutes per layer, or use a "magic number" in the code.

## 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

- You need to define a [method][methods] with two named parameters: `number_of_layers` and `actual_minutes_in_oven`.
- You can [implicitly return an integer][return] from the method.
- You can [invoke][invocation] one of the other methods you've defined previously.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for addition][operators] to add values.

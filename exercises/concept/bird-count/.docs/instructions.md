You're an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden in the last seven days.

You have five tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.

### 1. Check what the counts were last week

For comparison purposes, you always keep a copy of last week's counts nearby, which were: 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8 and 4. Implement the `BirdCount.last_week` method that returns last week's counts:

```ruby
BirdCount.last_week
# => [0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8, 4]
```

### 2. Check how many birds visited yesterday

Implement the `BirdCount#yesterday` method to return how many birds visited your garden yesterday. The bird counts are ordered by day, with the first element being the count of the oldest day, and the last element being today's count.

```ruby
birds_per_day = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1]
bird_count = new BirdCount(birds_per_day)
bird_count.yesterday
# => 4
```

### 3. Calculate the total number of visiting birds

Implement the `BirdCount#total` method to return the total number of birds that have visited your garden:

```ruby
birds_per_day = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1]
bird_count = new BirdCount(birds_per_day)
bird_count.total
# => 19
```

### 4. Calculate the number of busy days

Some days are busier that others. A busy day is one where five or more birds have visited your garden.
Implement the `BirdCount#busy_days` method to return the number of busy days:

```ruby
birds_per_day = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1]
bird_count = new BirdCount(birds_per_day)
bird_count.busy_days
# => 2
```

### 5. Check if there was a day with no visiting birds

Implement the `BirdCount#day_without_birds?` method that returns `true` if there was a day at which zero birds visited the garden; otherwise, return `false`:

```ruby
birds_per_day = [2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1]
ird_count = new BirdCount(birds_per_day)
bird_count.day_without_birds?
# => true
```

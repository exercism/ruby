# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Arrays in Ruby.

Of the many available Ruby collections, we chose to use the `array` collection type as the first collection type students will be taught for the following reasons:

- Arrays are a common data type in many languages.
- Arrays have a fixed length. No complexity in adding or removing elements.
- Arrays have a simple shorthand syntax. No need to understand how initializers work to define an array.

## Learning objectives

- The existence of the `Array` object.
- Defining an array.
- Accessing elements in an array by index.
- Iterating over elements in an array.
- Basic array methods (like size or sum).

## Out of scope

- Multi-dimensional/jagged arrays.
- Memory and performance characteristics of arrays.
- Iterators.

## Concepts

This Concepts Exercise's Concepts are:

- `arrays`: know of the existence of the `Array` object; know how to define an array; know how to access elements in an array by index; know how to iterate over elements in an array; know of some basic functions.
- `enumeration`: know how to iterate over a collection.

## Prerequisites

This exercise's prerequisites Concepts are:

- `classes`: know how to work with instance variables.
- `for-loops`: know what a `for` loop is.
- `booleans`: know what a `boolean` is.
- `basics`: know how to assign and update variables.

# Design

## Goal

This concept exercise is meant to teach an understanding/use of **decomposition** and the `*` (splat) and `**` (double splat) operators in Ruby.

<br>

## Learning objectives

- Understand/use **decomposition** through the use of splat operators (`*` and `**`) operators in various scenarios
  - `*` and `**` as _prefixes_ ..... not to be confused with `*` (_multiply_) and `**` (_exponentiation_) as _infix_, or mathematical operators (**consider a link in the links doc or a mention in dig deeper.**)
  - use in arguments to **methods**
  - use in argument _capture_ for **methods** (_aka passing an arbitrary number of arguments -- *args * & \*\*kwargs_)
  - use in **array** decomposition & construction
  - use in **hash** decomposition & construction
- Understand/use **decomposition** via `multiple assignment**
  - using **multiple assignment** in place of **indexing**
  - using **multiple assignment** + `*` in place of **slicing**
  - decomposition plus "leftovers" via `*`
- Differences between straight **multiple assignment** and `*` & `**`
- Deep decomposition

  # Problems in exercism evolve over time, as we find better ways to ask

  # The version number refers to the version of the problem you solved,
  # not your solution.

  # Define a constant named VERSION inside of the top level BookKeeping
  # module, which may be placed near the end of your file.
  #
  # In your file, it will look like this:
  #
  # module BookKeeping
  #   VERSION = 1 # Where the version number matches the one in the test.
